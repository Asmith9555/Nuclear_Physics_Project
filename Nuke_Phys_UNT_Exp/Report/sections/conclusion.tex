While there is no strong correlation between the two models, the fact that
both models can even be fitted by the same function and follow the same shape,
is good evidence that there is a 180 degree correlation between gamma rays.
While this analysis doesn't prove without a doubt that the angular correlation
is always 180 degrees, it does fall in line with the narrative hypothesiszed.
Due to the conservation of momentum and the data collected, it is very likely
the correlated angle between coincident gamma rays is 180 degrees.
